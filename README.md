# Driving-Theory-Exam-Simulator
This Java project is a graphical desktop application that simulates a driving theory exam, built using the Swing library for GUI components.
The program guides users through a randomized series of multiple-choice questions related to traffic signs and road safety, emulating the structure of official driving tests.
